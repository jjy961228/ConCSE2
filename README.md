**ConCSE: Unified Contrastive Learning and Augmentation for Code-Switched Embeddings**

This repository contains the code and proposed Koglish datasets for our paper [ConCSE: Unified Contrastive Learning and Augmentation for Code-Switched Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00120)

The contents of the folder are as follows : 
1. koglish_dataset: Contained examples of data from the Koglish-GLUE, Koglish-NLI, and Koglish-STS datasets.
2. Koglish_test: Koglish dataset validation experiment performed in Section 5.1.
3. ConCSE_test: Experiments with our proposed ConCSE from Section 5.2.
